1
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,790
It's so dark.

2
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,500
It's so dark.

3
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,080
It's so dark.

4
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,120
Iiit's soooo daaaark.

5
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,080
Shut it.

6
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,000
Sorry.

7
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,450
It's okay.

8
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,750
Then, can I turn on the lantern?

9
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,870
No.

10
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,830
Awww.

11
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,870
Save it.

12
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,370
We don't know where we'll find
the next refueling station.

13
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,790
Well, we've been in the dark for a while,
so my eyes might've gotten used to it.

14
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,580
We haven't seen the light of day in a while now.

15
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,700
Don't even know how many days it's been.

16
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,950
But seriously, where are we right now?

17
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,410
How'd we get into this place?

18
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,620
C'mon, Yuu, who do you think it was
who said they wanted to go into the hole?

19
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,700
I think it was you, Chi?

20
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,870
It was you.

21
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,660
Come on, that's an old saying, isn't it?

22
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,410
Doesn't it go, "I wish I could just climb into a hole"?

23
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,830
Does it mean it that literally?

24
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,950
In either case, we've gotta find a way out.

25
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,160
We don't have that much food left, huh?

26
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, even if we get outta here,
we don't know if we'll find food.

27
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,700
What's gonna happen to us, huh?

28
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,080
When will we get to the top of...

29
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,250
Hey.

30
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,370
Guess I'll sleep, too.

31
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,830
What's the soup like?

32
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,580
It's so smooth...

33
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,870
No, it's so thick...

34
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,290
So warm.

35
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,910
I'm hungry.

36
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,370
I'm cold...

37
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,700
There's a breeze!

38
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,500
Hey, wake up!

39
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,910
C'mon! Yuu!

40
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,080
Yeah. If we go the way the wind's blowing...

41
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,660
...we'll find a way out?

42
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,160
Yeah.

43
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There.

44
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Well?

45
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,410
That way.

46
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,830
Okay.

47
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,500
Now it's that way.

48
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Got it.

49
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,200
Light...

50
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,410
Wow!

51
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,830
It's so bright, Chi!

52
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,540
It was nighttime...

53
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,080
Hey, since we finally made it outside,
let's have some soup, c'mon!

54
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,830
Fine, just to celebrate getting out of there.

55
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,540
Alright, food!

56
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,750
Gotta be good now, right?

57
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,580
Yeah.

58
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,370
Here.

59
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,370
It's our last can.

60
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,830
Right!

61
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,830
Hot!

62
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,290
So good!

63
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,580
I never knew nighttime was this bright.

64
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
That's because we were in that
dark cavern that whole time.

65
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,290
It made us sensitive to light.

66
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,750
So what's gonna happen to us when the sun rises?

67
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,080
We'll burn to death.

68
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,250
Shut up!

69
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,500
Hit.

70
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,790
Hit.

71
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,500
Miss.

72
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,370
Huh?

73
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,450
Alright, last one.

74
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,910
You can keep on going if you want.

75
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,830
Hit.

76
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,660
Hit.

77
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hit.

78
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,950
You wanna shoot, Chi?

79
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,000
No, I'm good.

80
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,370
You're a terrible shot, anyway.

81
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,330
Oh, shut up.

82
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,870
You don't carry a weapon?

83
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,750
I don't need one.

84
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,040
But there are so many.

85
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Most of them are just junk.

86
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,000
But I guess I could go look for one.

87
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,790
It doesn't have to be a weapon.
We might find something we could use.

88
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,750
Maybe we'll find food.

89
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,450
No, if we're looking for food here,

90
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,870
we'll either find something like rations, or find...

91
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,080
Machine gun.

92
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,250
Shells.

93
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,500
Tank.

94
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,700
Hey, you think a tank tastes good?

95
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,290
Give it a try.

96
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,160
Actually try it.

97
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,750
It's like a big weapon graveyard.

98
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,200
People long ago didn't have enough food, either.

99
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,870
So why'd they build all these weapons?

100
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,080
If they'd preserved food instead of making weapons,
our lives would be so much easier.

101
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,580
Well, they had their own problems, you know.

102
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,540
Like war.

103
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,790
Wow! A plane!

104
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,000
Did it really fly?

105
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,450
A long time ago, yeah.

106
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,200
I wanna fly.

107
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,950
That's impossible.

108
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,660
You wanna fly too, right, Chi?

109
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,500
Nope, not at all.

110
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,290
Is this a weapon, too?

111
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,290
I dunno.

112
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,950
But it was probably a bomber or something...

113
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,000
War means killing one another, right?

114
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,290
Why'd they do that?

115
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:43,660
Dunno. Their interests probably didn't
coincide with... the other side's!

116
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,750
So like, if there are three people,
but only enough food for two...

117
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,250
I bet that's when you've gotta
get your weapon and fight.

118
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,660
Same now, same then...

119
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,540
Huh?

120
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,290
There's a lotta different kinds.

121
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,500
Look, Chi, this looks real powerful!

122
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,620
Put that down.

123
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,750
We don't need guns.

124
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,750
There's something else we could use
way more than that... there!

125
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,750
Explosives.

126
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,790
Yup. We can use them to move stuff
in our way or break down walls.

127
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,160
There's a whole lot.

128
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,250
Yeah.

129
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,620
We'll take as much as we can...

130
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,290
Hey, Chi, what's this?

131
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,450
Dunno.

132
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,540
Rations!

133
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,700
Let's grab them.
Okay!

134
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,830
Ready, up!

135
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,870
Ready, go!

136
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,330
Nope, it's not gonna fly.

137
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,910
We don't need to fly, jeez.

138
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,080
That's too bad.

139
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,410
Not at all.

140
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,370
Look, it can totally fly!

141
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,790
It won't!

142
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,370
We flew!

143
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,040
I'm hungry.

144
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Yeah.

145
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Here's your half.

146
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,450
Thanks.

147
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,500
It's good.

148
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,120
Says it's chocolate flavored.

149
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,950
No idea what chocolate is, though...

150
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,540
There's one more left.

151
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,950
A pack of five? An odd number...

152
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,290
So we'll split it in half and...

153
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,410
Hey!

154
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,370
Don't move.

155
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,950
What are you doing?

156
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,250
I'm taking it.

157
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,120
I see. I should've carried a weapon too, huh...

158
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,910
Yep.

159
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,700
This is war.

160
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,700
Hey! You actually ate it!

161
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,950
Why, you!

162
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,120
Hey, Yuuri!

163
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,950
Ow!

164
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,370
Ow!

165
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,580
You little, you little!
Ow, ow!

166
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,080
Ow, ow!

167
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,450
You little brat!
That actually hurts!

168
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,620
That was the last one!
C'mon, Chi!

169
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,410
You little, you little brat!

170
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,700
Chi, jeez!

171
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,200
That was yummy.
